      "content": "# Sales Person Workflow\n\n## Overview\nAs a sales person, your primary responsibilities are:\n1. Creating and managing customer records (advertisers)\n2. Creating orders for advertising\n3. Managing copy (commercial audio files and scripts)\n4. Submitting orders for approval\n\n## Step 1: Creating an Advertiser\n\n### When to Create an Advertiser\n- A new business wants to advertise\n- An existing business changes ownership or contact information\n- You need to set up a new account\n\n### Required Information\n- **Name**: Business or organization name\n- **Contact Name**: Primary contact person\n- **Email**: Billing and communication email\n- **Phone**: Contact number\n- **Address**: Billing address (optional but recommended)\n- **Payment Terms**: How quickly they pay (e.g., Net 30, Net 15)\n- **Credit Limit**: Maximum amount they can owe at once\n\n### Steps\n1. Navigate to **Traffic > Advertisers**\n2. Click **Add Advertiser**\n3. Fill in all required fields\n4. Click **Save**\n\n### Working with Agencies\n\n**Important**: Agencies and advertisers are separate entities. An advertiser is the business being advertised, while an agency is a company that represents advertisers.\n\n**If the advertiser works through an agency**:\n1. First, create the **Advertiser** record (the actual business)\n2. Then, create or select the **Agency** record (if it doesn't exist)\n3. When creating the order, select BOTH:\n   - The advertiser (required)\n   - The agency (optional, but include if they're represented by one)\n\n**If the advertiser buys directly** (no agency):\n- Create only the advertiser record\n- Leave agency blank when creating orders\n- Invoices will go directly to the advertiser\n\n**See also**: \"Agencies and Advertisers\" concept in the Help Center for detailed explanation.\n\n## Step 2: Creating an Order\n\n### Order Basics\nAn order is a contract for advertising that specifies:\n- How many commercials (spots) to run\n- When they should run (date range)\n- What type of scheduling (ROS, Daypart, or Fixed Time)\n- How long each commercial is (15, 30, or 60 seconds)\n- How much it costs\n\n### Creating an Order\n1. Navigate to **Traffic > Orders**\n2. Click **New Order**\n3. Fill in order details:\n   - **Order Number**: Unique identifier (auto-generated if left blank)\n   - **Advertiser**: Select from your advertisers (required - this is the business being advertised)\n   - **Agency**: Select if advertiser is represented by an agency (optional - only if they work through an agency)\n   - **Sales Rep**: Your name\n\n**Understanding Advertiser vs Agency**:\n- **Advertiser** is always required - this is the business being advertised\n- **Agency** is optional - only include if the advertiser works through an advertising agency\n- If both are selected, billing typically goes to the agency\n- If only advertiser is selected, billing goes directly to the advertiser\n   - **Start Date**: When commercials should begin\n   - **End Date**: When commercials should end\n   - **Total Spots**: How many commercials to run\n   - **Spot Lengths**: 15, 30, or 60 seconds (can select multiple)\n   - **Rate Type**: \n     - **ROS** (Run of Schedule): Any time, most flexible\n     - **Daypart**: Specific time periods (Morning Drive, Afternoon Drive, etc.)\n     - **Fixed Time**: Exact times (e.g., 8:00 AM every day)\n   - **Rates**: Pricing information\n   - **Total Value**: Total cost of the order\n4. Click **Save**\n\n### Order Statuses\n- **DRAFT**: Still being created, not submitted\n- **PENDING**: Submitted for approval\n- **APPROVED**: Approved by sales manager, ready for scheduling\n- **ACTIVE**: Spots are being scheduled and airing\n- **COMPLETED**: All spots have aired\n- **CANCELLED**: Order was cancelled\n\n## Step 3: Managing Copy\n\n### What is Copy?\nCopy is the actual commercial - either:\n- A pre-recorded audio file\n- A script for a live read by the DJ\n\n### Uploading Copy\n1. Navigate to **Traffic > Copy Library**\n2. Click **Upload Copy**\n3. Select the order or advertiser\n4. Upload audio file or enter script text\n5. Set expiration date if needed\n6. Add copy instructions for live reads\n7. Click **Save**\n\n### Copy Versions\n- You can have multiple versions of the same commercial\n- Useful for A/B testing or seasonal variations\n- Each version can be assigned to different spots\n\n### Creating Spec Production Orders\n\nFor pitches, demos, or speculative work, you can create production orders without a sales order:\n\n1. Navigate to **Traffic > Copy Library**\n2. Find the copy item you want to use\n3. Click the **Create Spec Production Order** button (orange icon)\n4. Fill in:\n   - **Client Name**: Required - name of potential client\n   - **Spot Lengths**: Select 15, 30, or 60 seconds\n   - **Deadline**: When spot needs to be completed\n   - **Instructions**: Production details\n5. Click **Create Spec Order**\n\n**Note**: Spec spots are marked with \"SPEC\" type and don't require a sales order. They can be used for pitches and converted to regular orders when the client commits.\n\n**See also**: \"Spec Spots Workflow\" for detailed spec spot process.\n\n## Step 4: Submitting for Approval\n\nOnce your order is complete:\n1. Review all details\n2. Ensure copy is uploaded\n3. Change status from **DRAFT** to **PENDING**\n4. The sales manager will review and approve\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Always verify advertiser information before creating\n- Double-check order dates and spot counts\n- Upload copy as soon as possible\n- Communicate with traffic manager about special requirements\n- Keep notes on advertiser preferences\n",

Manage inventory and availability\n4. Resolve scheduling conflicts\n5. Handle makegoods\n\n## Step 1: Reviewing Approved Orders\n\n1. Navigate to **Traffic > Orders**\n2. Filter by status: **APPROVED** or **ACTIVE**\n3. Review order details:\n   - Rate type (ROS, Daypart, Fixed Time)\n   - Date range\n   - Spot count\n   - Spot lengths required\n\n## Step 2: Scheduling Spots\n\n**Important**: All spots must be scheduled for a specific station. The station determines which inventory, dayparts, and clock templates are available.\n\n### Automatic Scheduling\nFor ROS (Run of Schedule) orders:\n1. Select the order\n2. **Select Station**: Choose which station to schedule spots for\n3. Click **Schedule Spots**\n4. System automatically distributes spots across date range for that station\n5. Review and adjust as needed\n\n### Daypart Scheduling\nFor daypart-specific orders:\n1. Select the order\n2. **Select Station**: Choose which station to schedule spots for\n3.

System checks for conflicts\n\n### Station-Specific Considerations\n\n- **Inventory**: Each station has its own inventory and availability\n- **Dayparts**: Dayparts are station-specific\n- **Break Structures**: Each station has its own break structures\n- **Filtering**: Use station filters to see only relevant spots and inventory\n\n## Step 3: Managing Break Positions\n\nBreak positions (A, B, C, etc.) indicate where in a commercial break a spot plays:\n- **A Position**: First in break (premium rate)\n- **B Position**: Second in break\n- **C Position**: Third in break\n- And so on...\n\nAssign break positions based on:\n- Order requirements\n- Rate structure\n- Advertiser preferences\n\n## Step 4: Conflict Resolution\n\n### Types of Conflicts\n- **Time Overlap**: Multiple spots scheduled at same time\n- **Oversell**: Too many spots in one hour\n- **Missing Copy**: Spot scheduled but no copy available\n\n### Resolving Conflicts\n1. Navigate to **Traffic > Spot Scheduler**\n2. View conflict warnings\n3. Adjust spot times\n4. Move spots to different times\n5. Mark conflicts as resolved\n\n## Step 5: Inventory Management\n\n1. Navigate to **Analytics > Inventory**\n2. View availability by:\n   - Date\n   - Hour\n   - Daypart\n3. Identify open inventory\n4. Fill with ROS spots if needed\n\n## Step 6: Makegoods\n\nWhen a spot doesn't air:\n1. Identify missed spot\n2. Navigate to **Billing > Makegoods**\n3. Create makegood record\n4. Schedule replacement spot\n5. Makegood is free to advertiser\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Schedule spots promptly after approval\n- Balance inventory across dayparts\n- Monitor for conflicts daily\n- Communicate with log generator about special requirements\n- Keep accurate records of makegoods\n",

Click **Generate Log**\n\n### What Gets Generated\n- Complete schedule for the day\n- All scheduled spots placed\n- Music selected from library\n- IDs, news, and other elements\n- Precise timing for each element\n\n## Step 3: Reviewing the Log\n\n1. Open the generated log\n2. Review timeline view\n3. Check each hour:\n   - Spot placement\n   - Music selection\n   - Timing accuracy\n   - Flow and pacing\n\n## Step 4: Editing the Log\n\n### Adding Spots\n1. Select hour and time\n2. Click **Add Spot**\n3. Choose spot from available inventory\n4. Place in schedule\n\n### Moving Elements\n1. Drag and drop to new time\n2. System adjusts timing\n3. Verify no conflicts\n\n### Removing Elements\n1. Select element\n2. Click **Remove**\n3. System adjusts remaining elements\n\n**Note**: Once published, logs are locked and cannot be edited.\n\n## Step 5: Resolving Conflicts\n\nConflicts may include:\n- Overlapping spots\n- Missing copy\n- Timing issues\n\n1. View conflict list\n2. Resolve each conflict:\n   - Move conflicting spots\n   - Replace missing copy\n   - Adjust timing\n3. Mark as resolved\n\n## Step 6: Publishing to LibreTime\n\nOnce log is complete:\n1. Review entire log one final time\n2. Click **Publish**\n3. Log is sent to LibreTime automation system\n   - Uses station-specific LibreTime configuration if set\n   - Falls back to global settings if station config not available\n4. Log status changes to **PUBLISHED**\n5. Log is locked (cannot be edited)\n\n### After Publishing\n- Log appears in LibreTime\n- Automation system uses log for playback\n- Changes require creating new log revision\n\n### Station-Specific LibreTime Configuration\n\n- Each station can have its own LibreTime API settings\n- Configure in **Admin > Stations** > Edit Station > LibreTime Integration\n- If not set, system uses global LibreTime settings\n- Allows different stations to use different LibreTime instances\n\n## Step 7: Locking/Unlocking Logs\n\n- **Lock**: Prevents accidental edits\n- **Unlock**: Allows editing (before publishing)\n\nUse locking when:\n- Log is complete but not yet published\n- You want to prevent changes\n- Multiple people work on logs\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Generate logs well in advance\n- Review previews before generating\n- Check for conflicts early\n- Communicate with traffic manager about issues\n- Publish on schedule\n- Keep backup of important logs\n",

      "content": "# Spec Spots Workflow\n\n## Overview\nSpec spots (speculative spots) are production orders created without an associated sales order. They're useful for:\n- Creating demo commercials for potential clients\n- Producing spots for pitches and presentations\n- Working on speculative projects before client commitment\n- Testing creative concepts\n\n## When to Use Spec Spots\n\nUse spec spots when:\n- Client hasn't committed to an order yet\n- You want to create a demo to show a potential client\n- You're pitching new business and need sample work\n- You want to produce spots before finalizing order details\n\n**Note**: Spec spots can later be linked to a sales order when the client commits.\n\n## Step 1: Create Copy\n\n1. Navigate to **Traffic > Copy Library**\n2. Click **Upload Copy**\n3. Upload audio file or enter script text\n4. Add any production notes or instructions\n5. Click **Save**\n\n**Note**: Copy for spec spots doesn't need to be linked to an order initially.\n\n## Step 2: Create Spec Production Order\n\n1. In **Copy Library**, find the copy item you want to use\n2. Click the **Create Spec Production Order** button (orange icon)\n3. Fill in the spec order form:\n   - **Client Name**: Required - name of the potential client\n   - **Spot Lengths**: Select 15, 30, or 60 seconds (can select multiple)\n   - **Deadline**: When the spot needs to be completed (optional)\n   - **Instructions**: Production instructions, talent needs, audio references, etc.\n4. Click **Create Spec Order**\n\n### What Happens\n- Production order is created with type \"SPEC\"\n- No sales order is required\n- Order appears in **Production > Production Orders** with \"SPEC\" badge\n- Production team can begin work immediately\n\n## Step 3: Production Process\n\nThe spec production order follows the same workflow as regular production orders:\n1. **PENDING**: Order created, waiting for assignment\n2. **ASSIGNED**: Assigned to producer/talent\n3. **IN_PROGRESS**: Production in progress\n4. **QC**: Quality control review\n5. **COMPLETED**: Production finished\n6. **DELIVERED**: Delivered to traffic/copy library\n\n## Step 4: Converting to Order (Optional)\n\nWhen the client commits to an order:\n1. Create the sales order in **Traffic > Orders**\n2. Link the spec production order to the new sales order (if supported)\n3. Or create a new production order from the sales order\n4. The spec spot can be used as reference or converted\n\n## Step 5: Using Spec Spots\n\nOnce completed, spec spots can be:\n- Used in pitches and presentations\n- Shown to potential clients as examples\n- Converted to regular production orders when client commits\n- Archived for portfolio/reference\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Clearly label spec spots with client name\n- Document the purpose of each spec spot\n- Track which spec spots convert to orders\n- Use spec spots strategically for high-value prospects\n- Don't over-produce spec spots (they cost time/money)\n- Communicate with production team about spec spot priorities\n\n## Differences from Regular Production Orders\n\n| Feature | Regular Production Order | Spec Spot |\n|---------|-------------------------|----------|\n| Sales Order Required | Yes | No |\n| Order Type | Standard | SPEC |\n| Client Name | From order | Required in form |\n| Advertiser ID | From order | Optional |\n| Billing | Linked to order | Not billed until converted |\n| Purpose | Fulfill order | Demo/pitch/reference |\n\n## See Also\n\n- \"Spec Spots\" concept article\n- \"Production Orders\" workflow\n- \"Sales Person Workflow\" for order creation\n",

      "content": "# Voice Tracking Workflow\n\n## Overview\n\nVoice tracking allows you to record voice elements (DJ breaks, liners, IDs) in advance and have them automatically inserted into logs. This workflow covers:\n1. Recording voice tracks\n2. Selecting voice tracks for breaks in logs\n3. Automatic syncing and file naming\n4. Uploading to LibreTime\n\n## Step 1: Recording Voice Tracks\n\n### Option A: Record Directly for a Break\n\n1. Navigate to **Logs** and open the log you're working on\n2. Find the break you want to record for (e.g., \"A break\" at 14:00)\n3. Click **Record** on the break slot\n4. Record your voice track\n5. Review the recording\n6. Click **Save**\n\n**What Happens Automatically:**\n- Voice track is created and linked to the break slot\n- File is saved with standardized name (e.g., `14-00_BreakA.mp3`)\n- Voice track info is synced to the log element\n- Slot status updates to \"recorded\"\n\n### Option B: Record Separately, Then Link\n\n1. Navigate to **Voice > Voice Recorder**\n2. Record your voice track\n3. Save the recording\n4. Later, when viewing the log:\n   - Find the break you want to assign it to\n   - Click **Select Voice Track**\n   - Choose your recorded track\n   - Click **Link**\n\n**What Happens Automatically:**\n- Voice track is linked to the break slot\n- File is renamed to standardized name (e.g., `14-00_BreakA.mp3`)\n- Voice track info is synced to the log element\n- Slot status updates to \"recorded\"\n\n### Option C: Upload Pre-Recorded File\n\n1. Navigate to **Voice > Voice Tracks**\n2. Click **Upload Voice Track**\n3. Select the break slot (optional - can link later)\n4. Upload your audio file\n5. Click **Save**\n\n**If slot_id is provided:**\n- Automatically links to slot\n- File is renamed to standardized name\n- Synced to log element\n\n**If no slot_id:**\n- File is saved with timestamp name\n- Can be linked to a slot later from the log view\n\n## Step 2: Selecting Voice Track for Break in Log\n\nWhen viewing a log and selecting a voice track for a break:\n\n1. Navigate to **Logs** and open the log\n2. Find the break that needs a voice track (shows as \"Pending\" or empty)\n3. Click **Select Voice Track** or **Link Voice Track**\n4. Choose from:\n   - Recently recorded tracks\n   - All available voice tracks\n   - Upload new track\n5. Click **Select** or **Link**\n\n**What Happens Automatically:**\n\n1. **Links to Slot**: Voice track is linked to the break slot\n2. **Sets Standardized Name**: Voice track gets standardized name from slot\n   - Format: `HH-00_BreakX` (e.g., `14-00_BreakA`)\n   - Hour (00-23) + \"-00\" + Break position (A, B, C, etc.)\n3. **Renames File**: Physical file is renamed to match standardized name\n   - Old: `20251123_143022_break123_take1.mp3`\n   - New: `14-00_BreakA.mp3`\n4. **Syncs to Log**: Log's JSON data is updated with:\n   - Voice track file path\n   - LibreTime ID (if uploaded)\n   - Voice track ID\n   - Standardized name\n   - Status: Not pending\n5. **Updates Status**: Slot status changes to \"recorded\"\n\n## Step 3: Understanding Standardized Names\n\n### Why Standardized Names?\n\n- **LibreTime Compatibility**: LibreTime expects specific filename formats in logs\n- **Automatic Matching**: When logs are sent to LibreTime, it can automatically match voice tracks\n- **Consistency**: All voice tracks follow the same naming convention\n- **Easy Identification**: You can tell which hour and break a track belongs to\n\n### Name Format\n\nFormat: `HH-00_BreakX`\n\n- **HH**: Hour in 24-hour format (00-23)\n- **00**: Minutes (always 00 for break start)\n- **BreakX**: Break position (A, B, C, D, E, etc.)\n\n### Examples\n\n- 14:00 (2:00 PM) A break → `14-00_BreakA.mp3`\n- 08:00 (8:00 AM) B break → `08-00_BreakB.mp3`\n- 20:00 (8:00 PM) C break → `20-00_BreakC.mp3`\n\n## Step 4: Uploading to LibreTime\n\nWhen ready to send voice tracks to LibreTime:\n\n1. Navigate to **Voice > Voice Tracks**\n2. Find the voice track you want to upload\n3. Click **Upload to LibreTime**\n4. System uploads the file\n\n**What Happens:**\n- File is uploaded with standardized filename (e.g., `14-00_BreakA.mp3`)\n- LibreTime receives the file with correct name\n- Voice track's `libretime_id` is updated\n- Voice track status changes to `READY`\n- Log element is updated with LibreTime ID\n\n**Important**: Upload voice tracks to LibreTime before publishing logs to ensure they're available when the log plays.\n\n## Step 5: Viewing Voice Tracks in Logs\n\nAfter selecting a voice track:\n\n1. Open the log\n2. Navigate to the hour with the break\n3. View the break element\n4. You should see:\n   - Voice track name\n   - File path\n   - Status: \"Recorded\" (not pending)\n   - LibreTime ID (if uploaded)\n\nIf voice track doesn't appear:\n- Verify it was linked to the slot\n- Check that log sync completed\n- Refresh the log view\n- Check for errors in system logs\n\n## Workflow Summary\n\n### Complete Workflow\n\n1. **Record or Upload** voice track\n2. **Select/Link** voice track to break in log\n3. **System Automatically**:\n   - Links to slot\n   - Sets standardized name\n   - Renames file\n   - Syncs to log\n4. **Upload to LibreTime** (when ready)\n5. **Publish Log** (voice track will be available)\n\n### Quick Workflow (Record for Break)\n\n1. Open log\n2. Click **Record** on break slot\n3. Record voice track\n4. Save (everything happens automatically)\n5. Upload to LibreTime\n6. Publish log\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- **Record Early**: Record voice tracks well before log publication\n- **Review Before Linking**: Listen to tracks before selecting them\n- **Use Standardized Names**: Let the system handle naming automatically\n- **Upload Before Publishing**: Upload to LibreTime before publishing logs\n- **Verify in Log**: Check that voice tracks appear correctly in log view\n- **Keep Backups**: Archive important voice tracks\n- **Label Clearly**: Use descriptive names when recording\n- **Test Playback**: Verify tracks play correctly before publishing\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Voice Track Not Appearing in Log\n\n- Verify voice track was linked to the slot\n- Check that sync completed (refresh log view)\n- Verify standardized name was set\n- Check system logs for errors\n\n### File Not Renamed\n\n- System should rename automatically when linked\n- If not renamed, check file permissions\n- Verify slot has standardized_name set\n- Try linking again\n\n### LibreTime Upload Fails\n\n- Verify LibreTime connection\n- Check API credentials\n- Verify file exists and is accessible\n- Check file format (MP3, WAV, etc.)\n- Review system logs for errors\n\n## Related Concepts\n\n- See \"Voice Tracking\" concept for overview\n- See \"Log Generation\" workflow for log creation\n- See \"LibreTime Integration\" for automation details\n",
