      "content": "# Sales Person Workflow\n\n## Overview\nAs a sales person, your primary responsibilities are:\n1. Creating and managing customer records (advertisers)\n2. Creating orders for advertising\n3. Managing copy (commercial audio files and scripts)\n4. Submitting orders for approval\n\n## Step 1: Creating an Advertiser\n\n### When to Create an Advertiser\n- A new business wants to advertise\n- An existing business changes ownership or contact information\n- You need to set up a new account\n\n### Required Information\n- **Name**: Business or organization name\n- **Contact Name**: Primary contact person\n- **Email**: Billing and communication email\n- **Phone**: Contact number\n- **Address**: Billing address (optional but recommended)\n- **Payment Terms**: How quickly they pay (e.g., Net 30, Net 15)\n- **Credit Limit**: Maximum amount they can owe at once\n\n### Steps\n1. Navigate to **Traffic > Advertisers**\n2. Click **Add Advertiser**\n3. Fill in all required fields\n4. Click **Save**\n\n### Working with Agencies\n\n**Important**: Agencies and advertisers are separate entities. An advertiser is the business being advertised, while an agency is a company that represents advertisers.\n\n**If the advertiser works through an agency**:\n1. First, create the **Advertiser** record (the actual business)\n2. Then, create or select the **Agency** record (if it doesn't exist)\n3. When creating the order, select BOTH:\n   - The advertiser (required)\n   - The agency (optional, but include if they're represented by one)\n\n**If the advertiser buys directly** (no agency):\n- Create only the advertiser record\n- Leave agency blank when creating orders\n- Invoices will go directly to the advertiser\n\n**See also**: \"Agencies and Advertisers\" concept in the Help Center for detailed explanation.\n\n## Step 2: Creating an Order\n\n### Order Basics\nAn order is a contract for advertising that specifies:\n- How many commercials (spots) to run\n- When they should run (date range)\n- What type of scheduling (ROS, Daypart, or Fixed Time)\n- How long each commercial is (15, 30, or 60 seconds)\n- How much it costs\n\n### Creating an Order\n1. Navigate to **Traffic > Orders**\n2. Click **New Order**\n3. Fill in order details:\n   - **Order Number**: Unique identifier (auto-generated if left blank)\n   - **Advertiser**: Select from your advertisers (required - this is the business being advertised)\n   - **Agency**: Select if advertiser is represented by an agency (optional - only if they work through an agency)\n   - **Sales Rep**: Your name\n\n**Understanding Advertiser vs Agency**:\n- **Advertiser** is always required - this is the business being advertised\n- **Agency** is optional - only include if the advertiser works through an advertising agency\n- If both are selected, billing typically goes to the agency\n- If only advertiser is selected, billing goes directly to the advertiser\n   - **Start Date**: When commercials should begin\n   - **End Date**: When commercials should end\n   - **Total Spots**: How many commercials to run\n   - **Spot Lengths**: 15, 30, or 60 seconds (can select multiple)\n   - **Rate Type**: \n     - **ROS** (Run of Schedule): Any time, most flexible\n     - **Daypart**: Specific time periods (Morning Drive, Afternoon Drive, etc.)\n     - **Fixed Time**: Exact times (e.g., 8:00 AM every day)\n   - **Rates**: Pricing information\n   - **Total Value**: Total cost of the order\n4. Click **Save**\n\n### Order Statuses\n- **DRAFT**: Still being created, not submitted\n- **PENDING**: Submitted for approval\n- **APPROVED**: Approved by sales manager, ready for scheduling\n- **ACTIVE**: Spots are being scheduled and airing\n- **COMPLETED**: All spots have aired\n- **CANCELLED**: Order was cancelled\n\n## Step 3: Managing Copy\n\n### What is Copy?\nCopy is the actual commercial - either:\n- A pre-recorded audio file\n- A script for a live read by the DJ\n\n### Uploading Copy\n1. Navigate to **Traffic > Copy Library**\n2. Click **Upload Copy**\n3. Select the order or advertiser\n4. Upload audio file or enter script text\n5. Set expiration date if needed\n6. Add copy instructions for live reads\n7. Click **Save**\n\n### Copy Versions\n- You can have multiple versions of the same commercial\n- Useful for A/B testing or seasonal variations\n- Each version can be assigned to different spots\n\n## Step 4: Submitting for Approval\n\nOnce your order is complete:\n1. Review all details\n2. Ensure copy is uploaded\n3. Change status from **DRAFT** to **PENDING**\n4. The sales manager will review and approve\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Always verify advertiser information before creating\n- Double-check order dates and spot counts\n- Upload copy as soon as possible\n- Communicate with traffic manager about special requirements\n- Keep notes on advertiser preferences\n",
