      "content": "# Orders vs Spots vs Logs\n\n## Orders\n\nAn **Order** is a contract for advertising that specifies:\n- How many commercials to run (total spots)\n- When they should run (date range)\n- What type of scheduling (ROS, Daypart, Fixed Time)\n- How much it costs\n\nThink of an order as the \"contract\" or \"agreement.\"\n\n## Spots\n\nA **Spot** is a single commercial placement at a specific date and time.\n\n- One order can have many spots\n- Each spot has a scheduled date and time\n- Spots are created from orders by the traffic manager\n- Spots can be SCHEDULED, AIRED, MISSED, or CANCELLED\n\nThink of spots as the individual \"appointments\" for commercials.\n\n## Logs\n\nA **Daily Log** is the complete programming schedule for a day.\n\n- Contains all spots scheduled for that day\n- Also includes music, IDs, news, and other programming\n- Generated by the log generator\n- Published to the automation system (LibreTime)\n\nThink of a log as the \"playlist\" or \"schedule\" for the entire day.\n\n## Relationship\n\n1. **Sales Person** creates an **Order** (contract for 100 spots)\n2. **Traffic Manager** creates 100 **Spots** from that order (scheduled at specific times)\n3. **Log Generator** includes those spots in **Daily Logs** (one log per day)\n4. Spots air according to the log schedule\n\n## Example\n\n- **Order**: \"ABC Restaurant - 100 spots, Jan 1-31, ROS, 30 seconds\"\n- **Spots**: 100 individual spots scheduled throughout January\n- **Logs**: 31 daily logs (one for each day in January), each containing the spots scheduled for that day\n"

This is the actual client - the company paying for the commercials.\n\n**Examples**:\n- Local restaurant\n- Car dealership\n- Real estate agency\n- Non-profit organization\n\n## What is an Agency?\n\nAn **Agency** is an advertising firm that represents advertisers and buys commercial time on their behalf. Agencies act as intermediaries between advertisers and radio stations.\n\n**Examples**:\n- Full-service advertising agency\n- Media buying agency\n- Marketing firm\n\n## How They Work Together\n\n### Direct Advertisers (No Agency)\n\nSome businesses buy advertising directly from the radio station:\n\n- **Order Structure**:\n  - Advertiser: Required (the business)\n  - Agency: None\n  - Billing: Invoice sent directly to advertiser\n\n**Example**:\n- Advertiser: \"Joe's Pizza\"\n- Agency: None\n- Invoice goes to: Joe's Pizza\n\n### Agency-Represented Advertisers\n\nSome businesses work through advertising agencies:\n\n- **Order Structure**:\n  - Advertiser: Required (the business being advertised)\n  - Agency: Required (the agency representing them)\n  - Billing: Invoice typically sent to agency (who then bills the advertiser)\n\n**Example**:\n- Advertiser: \"Joe's Pizza\"\n- Agency: \"ABC Advertising Agency\"\n- Invoice goes to: ABC Advertising Agency\n\n## Key Points\n\n1. **Agencies are NOT tied to advertisers** - They are separate entities\n2. **An order can have BOTH an advertiser AND an agency**\n3. **The advertiser is always required** - This is the business being advertised\n4. **The agency is optional** - Only include if the advertiser is represented by an agency\n5. **Billing typically goes to the agency** if one is specified, otherwise to the advertiser\n\n## When to Create an Agency Record\n\nCreate an agency when:\n- An advertiser tells you they work with an agency\n- A media buyer contacts you on behalf of a client\n- You receive orders from an agency representing multiple clients\n- Billing should go to the agency, not the advertiser directly\n\n## Agency Commission\n\nAgencies may receive commission:\n- Commission rate is set in the agency record\n- Commission is calculated on orders\n- Typically 15% of gross order value\n\n## Creating Records\n\n### Creating an Advertiser\n\n1. Navigate to **Traffic > Advertisers**\n2. Click **Add Advertiser**\n3. Enter advertiser information:\n   - Business name\n   - Contact information\n   - Payment terms\n   - Credit limit\n\n### Creating an Agency\n\n1. Navigate to **Traffic > Agencies**\n2.

It's like a credit card limit - once reached, no new orders can be approved until payment is received.\n\n## Why Credit Limits Matter\n\n- **Risk Management**: Protects station from bad debt\n- **Order Approval**: Orders exceeding limit cannot be approved\n- **Cash Flow**: Ensures timely payment\n- **Account Management**: Helps track advertiser financial health\n\n## How Credit Limits Work\n\n### Setting Credit Limits\n\nWhen creating an advertiser:\n1. Review advertiser's financial history\n2. Set appropriate credit limit\n3. Consider:\n   - Payment history\n   - Business size\n   - Industry standards\n   - Station policy\n\n### Checking Credit\n\nBefore approving orders:\n1. System checks current balance\n2. Calculates: Current Balance + New Order Value\n3. Compares to credit limit\n4. Approves or rejects based on limit\n\n### When Limit is Exceeded\n\nIf order would exceed limit:\n- Order cannot be approved\n- Sales manager sees warning\n- Options:\n  - Request payment on existing invoices\n  - Increase credit limit (if justified)\n  - Require payment before order approval\n\n## Payment Terms\n\nPayment terms specify when invoices are due.\n\n### Common Payment Terms\n\n**Net 30**\n- Payment due 30 days after invoice date\n- Most common term\n- Example: Invoice dated Jan 1, due Jan 31\n\n**Net 15**\n- Payment due 15 days after invoice date\n- Faster payment\n- Example: Invoice dated Jan 1, due Jan 16\n\n**Due on Receipt**\n- Payment due immediately\n- No grace period\n- Used for new or risky accounts\n\n**Net 60**\n- Payment due 60 days after invoice date\n- Longer terms\n- Used for large accounts or special arrangements\n\n## How Payment Terms Affect Orders\n\n### Order Approval\n- Sales manager considers payment terms\n- Accounts with poor payment history may need stricter terms\n- New accounts may require \"Due on Receipt\"\n\n### Credit Management\n- Accounts with Net 30 may have higher credit limits\n- Accounts with \"Due on Receipt\" may have lower limits\n- Payment history affects future terms\n\n## Setting Payment Terms\n\nWhen creating an advertiser:\n1. Consider industry standards\n2. Review payment history (if existing)\n3. Set terms appropriate for account\n4. Update if payment behavior changes\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Set realistic credit limits\n- Review limits regularly\n- Monitor payment history\n- Update terms based on behavior\n- Communicate clearly about terms\n- Enforce limits consistently\n\n## Related Concepts\n\n- See \"Order Approval Process\" for how credit affects approval\n- See \"Invoice Lifecycle\" for payment tracking\n"

It's like a template that says \"at 15 minutes past the hour, there's a 2-minute break with 3 spots.\"\n\n## Why Break Structures Matter\n\n- **Consistency**: Ensures breaks happen at predictable times\n- **Position Assignment**: Determines A, B, C positions\n- **Inventory Management**: Defines available commercial time\n- **Pricing**: A-position spots cost more\n- **Programming Flow**: Maintains consistent programming rhythm\n\n## How Breaks Are Structured\n\n### Break Positions (A, B, C, etc.)\n\n- **A Position**: First spot in the break (premium)\n- **B Position**: Second spot in the break\n- **C Position**: Third spot in the break\n- **D, E, F...**: Additional positions\n\n### Break Timing\n\nBreaks are defined by:\n- **Hour**: Which hour of the day (0-23)\n- **Time Offset**: Seconds from hour start (e.g., 900 = 15 minutes)\n- **Duration**: How long the break lasts\n- **Spot Count**: How many spots fit in break\n\n### Example Break Structure\n\n**8:00 AM Hour**:\n- Break 1: 8:15:00 (15 minutes past hour)\n  - 3 spots, 2 minutes total\n  - Positions: A, B, C\n- Break 2: 8:45:00 (45 minutes past hour)\n  - 2 spots, 1.5 minutes total\n  - Positions: A, B\n\n## Break Structures and Clock Templates\n\nBreak structures work with clock templates:\n- **Clock Templates**: Define overall hour structure (music, news, breaks)\n- **Break Structures**: Define specific break timing and positions\n- **Together**: Create complete programming schedule\n\n## How Spots Are Placed in Breaks\n\n1. Traffic manager schedules spot\n2. System identifies appropriate break\n3. System assigns position (A, B, C, etc.)\n4. Position based on:\n   - Order requirements\n   - Rate structure\n   - Advertiser preferences\n   - Availability\n\n## Position Pricing\n\n- **A Position**: Premium rate (highest)\n- **B Position**: Standard rate\n- **C Position**: Standard or lower rate\n- **Later Positions**: Lower rates\n\nWhy A-position costs more:\n- Listeners most likely to hear it\n- Highest retention rate\n- Premium placement\n\n## Break Structure by Hour\n\nDifferent hours may have different break structures:\n- **Morning Drive**: More breaks, more spots\n- **Midday**: Moderate breaks\n- **Evening**: Fewer breaks\n- **Overnight**: Minimal breaks\n\n## Creating Break Structures\n\n1. Navigate to break structure management\n2. Select hour (0-23)\n3. Define break times\n4. Set number of positions\n5. Set break duration\n6. Save structure\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Keep break structures consistent\n- Align with clock templates\n- Consider listener experience\n- Balance commercial time with programming\n- Review and adjust based on performance\n\n## Related Concepts\n\n- See \"Dayparts and Break Positions\" for position details\n- See \"Clock Templates\" for overall programming structure\n"
