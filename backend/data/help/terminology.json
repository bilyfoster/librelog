      "veteran_explanation": "Break position indicates the sequential placement of a spot within a commercial break. Positions are typically labeled A (first), B (second), C (third), etc. A-position spots command premium rates due to higher listener retention at the start of breaks.",

Invoices typically go to the agency, who then bills the advertiser.",
      "veteran_explanation": "An agency is an advertising firm that purchases commercial inventory on behalf of clients. Agencies are separate entities from advertisers - they are not tied together. An order can have both an advertiser (required) and an agency (optional). Agencies may receive commission (typically 15%), have different rate structures, and handle billing for multiple advertisers.
